#Rules:
//whenever you want to add something, change main() and do a 'PULL_REQUEST' to see what changes have been made.
//if you have an extra class or header file, upload that header file using upload file.
//NEVER upload folders, only headers,cpp files and images or audio files.
//we both well have the same main.cpp, copy and past the new files into your visual studio solution.
//no one should change or remove some of the other persons code without permission.
//if possible, use object oriented programing and header files a lot rather than adding to the main() unnecessarily. 
//changes to README.md should be commited directly to 'MASTER'.
